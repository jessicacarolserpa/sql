In the error handler, modify the code so that if a transaction is in process, it is rolled back and the error is re-thrown to the client application. If not transaction is in process the error handler should continue to simply print the error message. To test your transaction, add a THROW statement between the two DELETE statements to simulate an unexpected error. When testing with a valid, existing order ID, the error should be re-thrown by the error handler and no rows should be deleted from either table."
